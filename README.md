# Interactive Halloween VR Game

Kind of hard to summarise what this is, essentially you can build a map on a web interface

Then submit that map, then I would be put into your VR world, and you would be able to spawn monsters and trigger events to take place in the world.

My goal would be to retrieve the key and your goal would be to make sure that I do not.

I also created a heart rate tracker app for me Apple Watch that would stream my heart rate to the game, if my heart rate increased the monsters seeking ability would also increase making the monster _thrive from fear_. The heart rate from the real smart watch is displayed on a virtual smart watch

## TODO

Would be great if this was more portable and could allow people to somewhat quickly set it up on their personal machines and have friends make them maps and have them inside the game, but right now, without decent programming and computer knowledge I don't think people would be able to set it up on their machine without an extensive list of things to do.
